# SBRG(2.0): Spectrum Bifurcation Renormalization Group
(This is an update of the SBRG algorithm. New version contains link to `Qutip` packages, calculating physical observables, and etc)
SBRG is an algorithm motivated by RSRG-X. Instead of getting just ground state information, SBRG will calculate the effective Hamiltonian for many-body localized(MBL) systems. You can use the effective Hamiltonian to calculate the full spectrum of the original many-body system. This algorithm has been applied to study:
- MBL physics
- Holography network
- Infinite-randomness critical point(IRCP) in 1D and 2D
- IRCP with symmetry protected topological states
